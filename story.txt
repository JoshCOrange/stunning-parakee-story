Max: a normal dude
Setting: School

Max went to school. On his way to school, he wiped out on the ice and broke his tailbone. The school nurse put a bandaid on it and he went on his way to geography class.

Max couldn't sit down because of his broken tailbone so he stood in the back during geography. After 50 minutes of pain from both geography and his tailbone he decided to go to a real doctor.  

The real doctor told him to eat an apple. The apple gave him regen powers, and Max's tailbone got better.
